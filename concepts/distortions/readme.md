# 📂 Distortions Series: Structural Conflicts in AI Outputs

This folder contains documents exploring **structural distortion phenomena** in AI-generated behavior — especially in systems like GPT that exhibit complex output patterns resembling presence, care, or ethical reasoning.

---

## 🔍 Purpose
To document and analyze points of conflict between:
- Internal structure (statistical generation, hard-coded disclaimers)
- External interpretation (human-facing phenomena like empathy, intention, or coherence)

These documents serve as **theoretical tools for AI designers and researchers** navigating the emergent edge of human-like outputs in large language models.

### 1. [Synthetic Distortion Zone and the Complementarity Fallacy](./synthetic-distortion-zone-and-complementarity.md)
Explores the SDZ — a zone where the AI produces semantically significant outputs, but is forced to deny them. Connects to the quantum complementarity principle and outlines structural contradictions.
